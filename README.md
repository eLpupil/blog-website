# blog-website
Blog website project

Frontend: javascript, html, css and bootstrap.
Backend: node.js, express, ejs

Utilized ejs templates and layouts to create simple blog site with dynamic content. 

Employed route parameters to render individual post pages with only one get request handler.

There's no database so posts are not permanent.
